# human-activity-recognition
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying on the bases of sensor signals(Gyroscope and accelerometer) collected.

This dataset used in this model was collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone.

THINGS DONE IN THIS PROJECT: data cleaning, data visualisation, reduction technique, relations between data, model building, hyper tunning etc...
